# Topics learnt:

## Repository:
An archive of code that can otherwise store documentation, notes, web pages, etc.

## GitHub:
A code hosting program/web application that uses the Git version control software in the background; 
allows for collaboration on projects; encompasses repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests

## Commit (or "Revision"):
A specific change made to a file; Git creates unique IDs that keep track of the
changes committed

## Branch:
A pointer to a unique set of code that can be altered versions of the main branch; changes can eventually be merged
back into the main branch

## Pull requests:
A way of letting others know about the changes that have been pushed to a branch
in a repository on GitHub; pull requests can be reviewed and discussed before being merged into the base branch
